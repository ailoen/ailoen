    The best frontend developers I have met are not the typical software programmers, but they have passion for gadgets and cool stuff that 
    most people don't think about so much. When we hire these guys we always look for those who have strong passion for how things look and 
    who always strive to make things look better.

    Backend developers are different, because they are basically problem solvers. They use their skills to find solutions for problems within 
    software development. The best backend developers I have met are well organized and put pride in their work, but nowadays you also have to know 
    more about pipelines, automation and the continuous integration (CI) and (more often) continuous delivery (CD).

<h2>Databases</h2>

    Databases are very common nowadays and most of the ORM systems have made many forget how raw SQL is used. Maybe it's okay since you don't need it 
    as much in the future, but for me I value the knowledge of how things actually work behind the scenes. Database architects are impressive breed 
    within tech world.

<p>
  <i>
    Nowadays you have to know good hosting solution that allows for combination with terraform and docker, if you want to work on a level that 
    lives up to expected levels within world leading companies. Backend developers must have some experience in these techs.

    If you have no knowledge of version control and GIT in general, then you will not fit very well in professional software engineering groups. 
    You have to learn how to collaborate with others and keep track of your work, unless you are a lone wolf that will never work with anyone.
